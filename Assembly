Some prep may be necessary! Remove all panel burrs and test fit the main board in the enclosure. It should be snug but
not impossible to remove. 

Start by populating all SMD parts on the board:
R1    470 ohm Resistor
R2-4  75  ohm Resistor 
C1-4  220 uF  Capacitor
C5    10  uf  Capacitor
Ignore the bodge wire, this was a prototype board

Then solder in the VGA port and Audio jack

Insert the DIN 8 connector into the DIN 8 pcb. Make sure the connector is flush to the pcb.
Solder in the connector.

Insert angled header pins into the DIN 8 riser board. the pins should point in the same direction as the DIN 8 connector.
The middle pins will need to be trimmed down as close to flush with the board as possible. This is to keep the 
pins from getting in the way of the console. You may trim them all down like I did. 
Solder the pins in on both sides.

At this step your riser board should not be attached to the main board. Use flush cutters to remove the plastic spacers.
Then insert the pins into the main board. The fit will be extremely snug, I did not want any play as this is a large connector and 
can easily wear down if left with too much room. 

Make sure the riser is flush with the main board and at a 90 degree angle. Solder in one pin. 
Adjust as neccessary and then finish soldering the pins.

Make sure to trim the underside of the main board and don't leave too much of the pins exposed.
