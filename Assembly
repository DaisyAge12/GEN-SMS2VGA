Start by populating all SMD parts on the board:
R1    470 ohm Resistor
R2-4  75  ohm Resistor 
C1-4  220 uF  Capacitor
C5    10  uf  Capacitor

Then solder in the VGA port and Audio jack

Insert the DIN 8 connector into the DIN 8 pcb. Make sure the connector is flush to the pcb.

Solder in the connector.

Insert angled header pins as shown.

Solder one pin then adjust until all pins are inserted to the same depth.

Solder the rest of the pins in. 

Insert the assembled DIN 8 pcb into the main pcb, making sure the connector is facing the correct way.
Pay attention to the arrows on the PCB marking the direction the connector should go.

Solder in the pins.
