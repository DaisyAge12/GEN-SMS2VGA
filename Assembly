Start by populating all SMD parts on the board:
R1-4 - 470ohm Resistor
C1-4 220uF Capacitor
C5 10uf Capacitor

Then solder in the VGA port and Audio jack

Clip the plastic spacers off of 6 pins from the header connection

These 6 pins will be used to make a right angled DIN 8 connector

Clip three pins on the shortest side to about 2.5mm long. 

Try to be accurate here but at the very least make the pins the same length, the PCB should provide enough wiggle room if you are +-1mm off. 

Solder the short pins in first as shown. Pins 2, 3, and 4. 

Now solder in the full size pins as shown. Pins 6, 7, and 8.

This next part requires the use of a tool like a dremel or a lot of patience with clippers and a file. 
Remove part of the outer shield on both sides like this. The pins must not touch the shield or you risk damage to any devices this is connected to. 

Check your pins. Make sure they are as vertical as possible. Depending on how quickly you soldered the pins in, there will be some amount of play
in the plastic. With tweezers, turn the pins until satisfactory. If the pins do not move easily, apply heat with a soldering iron and move them quickly
before the part cools. 

Next inspect the side profile. Aim for a perfect 90 degree angle but again, the board should allow some play. 

Once the connector is done, solder it in. Pay attention to the arrows on the PCB marking the direction the connector should go.
Start by inserting the pins. Then Solder in the shield making sure the connector is straight.
Once aligned, hit the pins with plenty of solder.
