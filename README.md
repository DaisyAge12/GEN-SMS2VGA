# GEN-SMS2VGA
A Genesis 1 and Sega Master System RGBS output to VGA adapter

A HUGE shout out to Jeff Chen, who's Console VGA series is what got me to design this project. He currently had no plans to do a SMS/GEN1 version of his adapters,
but if he ever was to do one, I'd recommend you make his over mine.
